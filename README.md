## What is cloud computing
- The cloud computing are services that are accessed over the internet. Cloud servers are located inside data centers around the world and allow for on-demand availability of computer system resources, especially data storage and computing power, without direct active management by the user.  
### 3 benefits
- Cost saving is one of the biggest Cloud Computing benefits. It helps you to save money as it does not need any physical hardware investments.
- Security
- Loss Prevention
### best use cases/who is using it in the industry .
- AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform
- Website Hosting â€“ This is one of the most common business-oriented uses of cloud computing. While companies can host their web presences on physical servers or single cloud servers, the true scale and ability to grow comes when these business start enabling transactions or other web-based services within their hosted environments.

## What is AWS
- Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a cloud service provider. AWS offers a wide range of cloud services, from basic hosting and deployment to analytics, blockchain, machine learning, and more. 
### 3 advantages of AWS/who is using AWS in the industry (Netflix, Twitch, LinkedIn, Facebook)
- Flexible : AWS enables you to select the operating system, programming language, web application platform, database, and other services you need. With AWS, you receive a virtual environment that lets you load the software and services your application requires. 
- Cost-Effective : You pay only for the compute power, storage, and other resources you use, with no long-term contracts or up-front commitments.
- Secure : AWS utilizes an end-to-end approach to secure and harden our infrastructure, including physical, operational, and software measures.

Types of cloud computing
- over the cloud - public cloud (aws)
- on premises- private cloud (Vagrant, virtual box)
- hybrid cloud (50/50, example: banks, on-premises datacenter  with a public cloud, allowing data and applications to be shared between them.)

- SaaS - software as a service
- Infrastructure as a service ( IaaS )
- AI as a service ( AIaaS )

- scale out - (add new server) Scaling out a microservices application can be as simple as spinning up a new container running a webserver app and adding it to the load balancer pool. When scaling out the idea is that it is possible to add identical services to a system to increase performance. 
- scale up - (make server bigger) the goal is to increase the resources supporting your application to reach or maintain adequate performance. In a hardware-centric world, this might mean adding a larger hard drive to a computer for increased storage capacity.
